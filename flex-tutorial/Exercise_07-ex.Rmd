    # Assignment: Implement this function. The parameter is
    # a reactive expression. The return value should be a
    # reactive expression that, when invalidated, does *not*
    # invalidate its dependencies. In other words, the line
    # "Executing renderText" would get printed when x changes
    # from 9 to 10, but not get printed when it changes from
    # 8 to 9.
